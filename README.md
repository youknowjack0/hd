WebGL Browser Helicopter Game
==

An in-browser helicopter flight simulator. Depends upon three.js for rendering.

To use it, hold 'W' on the keyboard to power the rotor. 'A' and 'D' control the 'rudder' (i.e. change the power of the tail rotor), and the mouse position controls pitch and roll.

Development state: alpha
